1. Set up correct data layout for statistical analyses by running data_wrangle_1-5 in the data_wrangle folder of my project. For this the miseq, ideal sample, ideal calf and postmortem data will all be used from the edited original data folder of my project.
2. read script 15_miseq_bacteria_trends in the miseq data edits folder of this project to create bacteria load trends in relation to survival outcome
3. Read script 16_Km_sex in the miseq data edits folder of this project in order to create km plots showing the survival outcome impacted by calf sex.
4. Read script 17_Genomic_analyses from the miseq data edits folder of this project in order to create cox hazard model detailing the impact of genotype onsurvival outcome.
5. Read script 18_Kaplan-Meier from the miseq data edits folder of this project to view the impact the different bacterial levels differentiated by species have on survival outcomes.
6. Read script 19_LPT_positive_&_Negative from the miseq data edits folder of this project, this is a investigation of the survival outcome depending on a calfs infecfection with Theileria Parva first , or if the calf was first infected with Theileria Velifer or mutans before parva.
7. Read script 20_ticks from the miseq data edits folder of this project, this investigated whether the level of infestation by ticks impacts survival outcomes.
8. Read script 21_Early_vs_late_infestation from the miseq data edits folder of this project, looks at the timing of infection and the survival outcome.
